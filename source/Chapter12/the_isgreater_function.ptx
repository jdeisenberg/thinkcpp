        <title>The <c>isGreater</c> function</title>
        <p>For basic types like <c>int</c> and <c>double</c>, there are comparison
            operators that compare values and determine when one is greater or less
            than another. These operators (<c>&lt;</c> and <c>&gt;</c> and the others) don&#8217;t
            work for user-defined types. Just as we did for the <c>==</c> operator, we
            will write a comparison function that plays the role of the <c>&gt;</c>
            operator. Later, we will use this function to sort a deck of cards.</p>
        <p>Some sets are totally ordered, which means that you can compare any two
            elements and tell which is bigger. For example, the integers and the
            floating-point numbers are totally ordered. Some sets are unordered,
            which means that there is no meaningful way to say that one element is
            bigger than another. For example, the fruits are unordered, which is why
            we cannot compare apples and oranges. As another example, the <c>bool</c>
            type is unordered; we cannot say that <c>true</c> is greater than
            <c>false</c>.</p>
        <p>The set of playing cards is partially ordered, which means that
            sometimes we can compare cards and sometimes not. For example, I know
            that the 3 of Clubs is higher than the 2 of Clubs because it has higher
            rank, and the 3 of Diamonds is higher than the 3 of Clubs because it has
            higher suit. But which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds?
            One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit.</p>
        <p>In order to make cards comparable, we have to decide which is more
            important, rank or suit. To be honest, the choice is completely
            arbitrary. For the sake of choosing, I will say that suit is more
            important, because when you buy a new deck of cards, it comes sorted
            with all the Clubs together, followed by all the Diamonds, and so on.</p>
        <p>With that decided, we can write <c>isGreater</c>. Again, the arguments (two
            <c>Card</c>s) and the return type (boolean) are obvious, and again we
            have to choose between a member function and a nonmember function. This
            time, the arguments are not symmetric. It matters whether we want to
            know &#8220;Is A greater than B?&#8221; or &#8220;Is B greater than A?&#8221; Therefore I think
            it makes more sense to write <c>isGreater</c> as a member function:</p>
        <pre>bool Card::isGreater (const Card&amp; c2) const {
  // first check the suits
  if (suit &gt; c2.suit) return true;
  if (suit &lt; c2.suit) return false;

  // if the suits are equal, check the ranks
  if (rank &gt; c2.rank) return true;
  if (rank &lt; c2.rank) return false;

  // if the ranks are also equal, return false
  return false;
}</pre>
        <p>Then when we invoke it, it is obvious from the syntax which of the two
            possible questions we are asking:</p>
        <pre>Card card1 (2, 10);
Card card2 (2, 4);

if (card1.isGreater (card2)) {
  card1.print ();
  cout &lt;&lt; "is greater than" &lt;&lt; endl;
  card2.print ();
}</pre>
        <p>You can almost read it like English: &#8220;If card1 isGreater card2 &#8230;&#8221; The
            output of this program is</p>
        <pre>10 of Hearts
is greater than
4 of Hearts</pre>
        <p>According to <c>isGreater</c>, aces are less than deuces (2s). As an
            exercise, fix it so that aces are ranked higher than Kings, as they are
            in most card games.</p>
